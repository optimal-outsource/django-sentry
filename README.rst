Sentry
------

Sentry provides you with a generic interface to view and interact with your error logs. By
default, it will catch any exception thrown by Django and store it in a database. With this
it allows you to interact and view near real-time information to discover issues and more
easily trace them in your application.

This is a fork of the original django-sentry 1.13.5 and updated for Django 1.9.

If upgrading from an older version, apply the migrations.
